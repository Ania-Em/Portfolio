         <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
      </div>
      <article>
         <p class="article-description">The website's goal is to convey the Boho interior design that is the studio's
            preferable and dominant style. The offer is oriented on people, who value elegant, clear and natural
            approach to materials and space and want to receive an individual, unique design tailored for them. The
            client visiting the website for the first time should understand immediately what is the style of the studio
            and what kind of service it has to offer. At the same time, the furniture renovation offer needs to be
            focused on, with an equal presence on the website. Besides the designer wants to have space where she could
            share her thoughts, trends, tips on interior design, that would be mainly dedicated for people that are not
            her clients (yet), with hope to attract new clients and movement on the website.</p>

                  <h4>30 years old</h4>
                  <h4>Photographer</h4>
                  <p>Martina is a successful magazine photographer. She likes to be active, has a full schedule,
                     however,
                     she always can find time for a new art exhibition or gallery opening. If she had to describe
                     herself
                     in one word that would be "freedom". </p>

               <h4>Style</h4>
               <p>She has a very precise idea of what she would like her apartment to look like- Boho chic style. She
                  has just bought a new apartment in the modern glass-facade building in the city centre. However, after
                  a long, hard day at work, she would love to just relax and leave the busy city behind the apartment
                  door and to enter the completely different realm of peace and quiet.</p>

               <h4>Technical environment</h4>
               <p>Martina wants to hire an interior designer to design her apartment. She is searching for a designer
                  that conveys exactly the style she is looking for. She would use the website to go through all the
                  projects to decide whether or not she likes it. She is a very busy person who prefers to contact via
                  e-mail, in a written form- not to forget of any important agreements.</p>

                  <h4>52 years old</h4>
                  <h4>Nutritionist</h4>
                  <p>Victor is a nutritionist, interested in broadly speaking well-being and natural methods of reducing stress and anxiety levels, that he sees in so many of his patients lives. He has his medical practice, after work he devotes his free time to gardening and yoga.</p>

               <h4>Style</h4>
               <p>He has bought a small vacation house by the lake for himself and his family. He wants it to become a retreat place, surrounded by nature, far away from densely populated any urban area. He likes the style, where the materials are true, ecological and where there is a place for plants in all of the rooms. Because he inherited after his grandparents old, antique furniture he would like to renovate them and incorporate into the new interior design. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="persona-section">
               <h4>Technical environment</h4>
               <p>Victor is an old-fashioned client, he prefers to call on the phone or to see and talk directly to the designer. As he is planning on renovating old furniture and design a modern, boho style vacation house he is keen to hand both issues to the same person, to keep the style uniform and generate fewer problems.</p>
