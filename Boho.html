         <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      </div>
      <article>
         <p class="article-description">The website's goal is to convey the boho interior design that is the studio's
            preferable and dominant style. The offer is oriented on people, who value elegant, clear and natural
            approach to materials, space and want to receive an individual, unique design tailored for them. The
            client visiting the website for the first time should understand immediately what is the style of the studio
            and what kind of service it has to offer. What is more, the studio has just launched new offer- furniture
            renovation, which also needs to be
            focused on, with an equal presence on the website. The studio owner wants to have a safe space where
            she could
            share her thoughts, trends, tips on interior design, that would be mainly dedicated for people that are not
            her clients (yet), with hope to attract new clients and movement on the website.</p>

                  <h4>30 years old</h4>
                  <h4>Photographer</h4>
                  <p>Martina is a successful magazine photographer. She likes to be active, almost always has a full
                     schedule, yet she can always find time for a new art exhibition or gallery opening. If she had to describe
                     herself
                     in one word that would be "freedom". </p>

            <div class="persona-section">
               <h4>Style</h4>
               <p>She has a very precise idea of what she would like her apartment to look like- Boho chic style. She has just bought a new place in the modern building in the city centre. However, after a long, hard day at work, she would love to just relax and leave the busy city behind the apartment's door and enter the completely different realm of peace and quiet.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="persona-section">
               <h4>Technical environment</h4>
               <p>Martina is searching for an interior designer
                  that conveys exactly the style she is looking for. She likes to check thoroughly the websites of the services she wants to use, especially paying attention to the previous projects and feedbacks of other customers. She is a very busy person who prefers to contact via e-mail, or in any sort of a written form- she likes to keep a record of her inquiries.</p>

                  <h4>52 years old</h4>
                  <h4>Nutritionist</h4>
                  <p>Victor is a nutritionist, interested in well-being and natural methods of reducing
                     stress and anxiety levels. He has his own medical
                     practice. After work he devotes his free time to yoga, gardening and cooking.</p>

               <h4>Style</h4>
               <p>He recently has bought a small vacation house by the lake; for himself and his family. He wants it to become a
                  retreat place, surrounded by nature, far away from any urban area. He likes the interior
                  style, in which the materials are true, ecological with an important part of the design left for greenery. Because he inherited after his grandparents an old, antique furniture he would like to renovate
                  it and incorporate into the new interior design. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="persona-section">
               <h4>Technical environment</h4>
               <p>Victor is an old-fashioned client, he prefers to talk things over the phone or to meet in person. As he is planning on renovating old furniture and creating a modern, boho style vacation house he is keen to hand both issues to the same person. That way he will  keep the style uniform and generate fewer
                  problems on the way.</p>

      </div>
      <article class="usability-test">
         <p class="article-description"> Using a high-fidelity website's prototype I conducted usability tests on five individuals. My observations :</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The offer page included both offers for interior design and furniture renovation, because the last one was located down the page it was difficult to find and some users didn't realise it was even there.<br>>
               Clear separation of furniture renovation and interior design offer.
            </li>
            <li>It was difficult for users to read paragraphs of light font color on the pinkish background- Colors of
               small contrast ratio. <br>
               > Color of font consistent everywhere on the website - dark green, paired with background color - light
               beige - to give a contrast ratio of over 10 that meets WCAG standards.</li>
            <li>The logo of the website was perceived as not modern and too complicated.<br>
               > Logo redesign.</li>
            <li>Users were looking for a contact information after seeing the offer page. <br>
               > Link to contact form on the offer page.
            </li>
            <li>Users thought that pictures on the main page illustrating the paragraphs were clickable elements. <br> >
               Photos on the main page linked to the corresponding tab i.e. to interior design projects gallery.</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Learnings</h3>
      </div>
      <article class="learnings">
         <ul>
            <li>Sometimes users interact with the website not as expected. It is good to observe their first instinctive reactions and adjust the design to it, i.e. provide interactive elements if that is going to improve the user flow.</li>
            <li>Visual communication and design of the website were very important in this project. The wrong choice of colours, not contrasting enough or not associated with natural, boho style, could have a real impact on the user's behaviours and statistics of the website's traffic.</li>
            <li>If there was more time given the blog tab could have been created with more consideration.</li>
            <li>Users who don't know the website and enter it for the first time, look for specific information, do not have the will to scroll down or to search deeper in the structure of the website. If the specific section is highly visited or searched for, it should be accessible from the main page or menu.</li>
