         <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      </div>
      <article>
         <p class="article-description">The website's goal is to convey the Boho interior design that is the studio's
            preferable and dominant style. The offer is oriented on people, who value elegant, clear and natural
            approach to materials and space and want to receive an individual, unique design tailored for them. The
            client visiting the website for the first time should understand immediately what is the style of the studio
            and what kind of service it has to offer. At the same time, the furniture renovation offer needs to be
            focused on, with an equal presence on the website. Moreover the designer wants to have a safe space where
            she could
            share her thoughts, trends, tips on interior design, that would be mainly dedicated for people that are not
            her clients (yet), with hope to attract new clients and movement on the website.</p>

                  <h4>30 years old</h4>
                  <h4>Photographer</h4>
                  <p>Martina is a successful magazine photographer. She likes to be active, has a full schedule,
                     however,
                     she always can find time for a new art exhibition or gallery opening. If she had to describe
                     herself
                     in one word that would be "freedom". </p>

               <h4>Style</h4>
               <p>She has a very precise idea of what she would like her apartment to look like- Boho chic style. She
                  has just bought a new apartment in the modern glass-facade building in the city centre. However, after
                  a long, hard day at work, she would love to just relax and leave the busy city behind the apartment
                  door and to enter the completely different realm of peace and quiet.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="persona-section">
               <h4>Technical environment</h4>
               <p>Martina wants to hire an interior designer to design her apartment. She is searching for a designer
                  that conveys exactly the style she is looking for. She would use the website to go through all the
                  projects to decide whether or not she likes it. She is a very busy person who prefers to contact via
                  e-mail, in a written form- not to forget of any important agreements.</p>

                  <p>Victor is a nutritionist, interested in broadly speaking well-being and natural methods of reducing
                     stress and anxiety levels, that he sees in so many of his patients lives. He has his medical

               <p>He has bought a small vacation house by the lake for himself and his family. He wants it to become a
                  retreat place, surrounded by nature, far away from densely populated any urban area. He likes the
                  style, where the materials are true, ecological and where there is a place for plants in all of the
                  rooms. Because he inherited after his grandparents old, antique furniture he would like to renovate
                  them and incorporate into the new interior design. </p>

            <div class="persona-section">
               <h4>Technical environment</h4>
               <p>Victor is an old-fashioned client, he prefers to call on the phone or to see and talk directly to the
                  designer. As he is planning on renovating old furniture and design a modern, boho style vacation house
                  he is keen to hand both issues to the same person, to keep the style uniform and generate fewer
                  problems.</p>

      <article class="usability-test">
         <p class="article-description"> Using high-fidelity website's prototype I conducted usability
            tests on five individuals. My observations : </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Offer page included both offer for interior design and for furniture renovation, because the last one
               was located down the page it was difficult tofind and some users didn't realise it was even there. <br>>
               Clear separation of furniture renovation and interior design offer.
            </li>
            <li>It was difficult for users to read paragraphs of light font color on the pinkish background- Colors of
               small contrast ratio. <br>
               > Color of font consistent everywhere on the website - dark green, paired with background color - light
               beige - to give a contrast ratio of over 10 that meets WCAG standards.</li>
            <li>Logo of the website was perceived as not modern and too complicated.<br>
               > Logo redesign.</li>
            <li>Users were looking for a contact information after seeing the offer page. <br>
               > Link to contact form on the offer page.
            </li>
            <li>Users thought that pictures on the main page illustrating the paragraphs were clickable elements. <br> >
               Photos on the main page linked to the corresponding tab i.e. to interior design projects gallery.</li>

      </div>
      <article class="learnings">
         <ul>
            <li>Sometimes users interact with the webiste not as expected. It is good to use this knowledge and provide
               them with interactive elements if that is going to imporove user flow.</li>
            <li>Visual communication and design of the website was very importent in this project. Choice of the wrong
               colors, not contrasting enough or not associated with natural, boho style could have a real impact on the
               user's bahaviours and statistics of the website's traffic in general.</li>
            <li>If more time the blog tab could have been created with more consideration.</li>
            <li>Users who don't know the website and enter it for the first time, looking for some specific information,
               could not have the will to scroll down, search deeper in the structure of the website. If the specific
               section is highly visited or searched for it should be easily accessible from the main page or menu.</li>
