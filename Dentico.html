         <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      </div>
      <article>
         <p class="article-description">The app is designed for patients who visit the clinic regularly, but also for those who visit it only from time to time. The main function is to ease appointments booking - the patient can choose the doctor, read about their qualifications and education, choose which type of treatment one needs and then choose an hour and a day of the visit. All the booked appointments are visible in the calendar and can be changed or cancelled if needed. Dentico provides information about the dental condition of the patient. It makes the patient aware of their dental problems but also helps to take care of dental hygiene better and encourages them to visit a dentist more often.</p>

He prides himself in taking good care of his dental hygiene and at least once per year he goes for a follow-up dentist visit. From some time, though, he noticed that he might need more frequent visits as he has started to experience minor teeth problems.</p>

         <p class="article-description"> Using high-fidelity website's prototype I conducted usability tests on three individuals. My observations : </p>
         <ul>
            <li>It took a long time for users to find specific information in the app. They were confused and not certain about the contents of the four main categories on the home screen.<br>>
               "My profile" was replaced by "My medical documentation" and "My calendar" by "My appointments".
            </li>
            <li>After completing the booking process the user would be redirected immediately to the home screen, although I noticed that users just after that would still open the "My calendar" tab to see if their visit is in the system. <br>
               > I decided to follow users' preferences and after completing the booking process redirect them to the calendar, where they can see the visit and they can also change the details of it.</li>
            <li>Appointment's notifications were set up to first notification: 1 day before the visit and another one 1 hour before the visit. Users were looking for a way to change it, as they didn't feel these dates were suitable for them.<br>
               > The options to set up both notifications at any date and time was added.</li>

      </div>
      <article class="learnings">
         <ul>
            <li>Users like to be given a choice - whatever it's the time of the notifications or the time of the dental appointment.</li>
            <li>Every item that is on the home screen should be labelled with extra attention and should be tested, if some elements are labelled wrong here- at the beginning of the user's contact with an application, it can lead to user's frustration, feeling lost and anxious and finally not using it anymore.</li>
            <li>Sometimes what seems like a natural user flow might not be such, it is crucial to watch users perform simple tasks to watch what they are expecting to be next and what is a natural flow for them when it comes to this specific application.</li>
