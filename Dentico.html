         <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      </div>
      <article>
         <p class="article-description">The app is designed to be used by patients who visit the clinic regularly, and
            those who visit it only from time to time, mostly when they start having teeth pains or on a checkup
            appointment about once per year. The main function is to ease appointments booking - where the patient can
            choose the doctor, read about their qualifications and education, choose which type of treatment one needs
            and an hour and a day of the visit. All the booked appointments are visible in the calendar and can be
            changed or cancelled if needed. Dentico provides also information about the dental condition of the patient.
            It makes the patient aware of the exact dental problems one faces and being informed helps to take care of
            dental hygiene better and encourages to visit a dentist more often. </p>

                  per year he goes for a follow-up dentist visit. From some time though he noticed that he might need

            <li>It took a long time for users to find the specific information in the app. They were confused and not certain about the contants of the four main categories on the home screen.  <br>>
               "My profile" was replaced by "My medical documentation" and "My calendar" by "My appointments".
            </li>
            <li>After completing the booking process the user would be redirect immediately to the home screen, although I noticed that after that users would still open "My calendar" tab to see if their visit is in the system. <br>
               > I decided to follow users' preferences and after completing the booking process redirect them to the calendar, where they can see the visit and they can also change the details of it.</li>
            <li>Appointment's notifications were set up to: first notification: 1 day before the visit and another one 1 hour before the visit. Users were looking for a way to change it, as they didn't feel these dates were suitable for them. <br>
               > The options to set up both notifications at any date and time was added.</li>

            <li>Every item that is on the home screen should be labelled with extra attention and should be tested, if some elements are labelled wrong here- at the beginning of the user's contact with an application it can lead to user's frustration, feeling lost and anxious and finally not using it anymore.</li>
            <li>Sometimes what seems as a natural user flow might not be such, it is crucial to watch users perform simple tasks to watch what they are expecting to be next and what is natural flow for them when it comes to this specific application.</li>
